# corribirb app

This app was created to track feeding times and weight for my bird Corri, who was injured when she escaped her cage and got into a fight with a larger bird.  Since her injury, we need to hand feed her formula by syringe every few hours, and want to track how many mililiters she is consuming, and check her weight regularly to be sure she isn't losing.

Corri was injurt on March 4th, 2021 and to date is doing very well!
